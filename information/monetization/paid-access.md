# Paid access
## Price
This game will be paid access at 200 Robux. 

## Considerations
* This price lets the Everyone Destroys the World Group create discounts at certain events because it's not at the price floor.
* 200 Robux seems to be the sweet spot when comparing to similar games as of February 23, 2025. Examples:
  * [Find Everything](https://www.roblox.com/games/8389627336/Find-Everything): a platformer game with a story — 250 Robux
  * [Reign Fall](https://www.roblox.com/games/11765763028/Reign-Fall-Early-Development): a shooter game with a story — 80 Robux
  * [Rogue Lineage](https://www.roblox.com/games/3016661674/Rogue-Lineage): a fighting game with classes — 200 Robux
* Beastslash is a new company, so:
  * Charging too high is a turn off. 200 Robux is less than $2 USD, so it should be reasonable.
  * Charging too low may result in a loss.
  * The company should avoid using local currency as payment. Roblox only has a Robux wallet; customers would have to directly use their credit/debit card to purchase the game, something that is currently uncommon on Roblox.  
* This price is mainly for the story and customization features. The demo has access to live-service game modes as long as the demo player is in a party with a paying player.
