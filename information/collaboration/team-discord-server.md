# Team Discord server
There should have a Discord server for the members of The Everyone Destroys the World Group to communicate.

## Security
The Discord server should be secured from unauthorized third-parties. Administrators at least follow these guidelines:
* The administrators should avoid creating a permanent invite link for the server.
* Only administrators should be able to create invite links.
* New members must go through manual approval. This prevents unauthorized users from seeing the inside of the server.
* Channels should be inaccessible without a role. This prevents unauthorized members from gaining further access.
