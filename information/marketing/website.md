# Website
## Purpose
A website should be created to market the game towards players, creators, and other interested parties.

## Content
### All pages
#### Header
TBD

#### Footer
TBD

### Soundtrack page
There should be a page for visitors to listen to and find information about the Everyone Destroys the World Soundtrack. To increase reach and build an audience for the independent artists, the website should embed each song's applicable Soundcloud, Bandcamp, and YouTube pages instead of posting the .mp3 and .wav files directly. This will increase viewership on the third-party platforms so that they potentially recommend the soundtrack to other audiences.

## Domains
### Primary domain
The game's primary domain is [everyonedestroysthe.world](https://everyonedestroysthe.world). 

### Beastslash subdomain redirect
[everyonedestroystheworld.beastslash.com](https://everyonedestroystheworld.beastslash.com) should redirect to the primary domain. The Everyone Destroys the World Group should prioritize using the primary domain for content instead of the Beastslash subdomain. If Beastslash were to spin off Everyone Destroys the World, the website can be easily transferred.

### Other official domain redirects
Other domains can be considered to prevent user confusion and catch potential typos, but this should be a low priority for now. The Everyone Destroys the World Group currently cannot allocate funds towards this.
