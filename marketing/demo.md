# Demo
The game will have a demo version to let the player get a feel for what they'll be getting into.

## Differences from the demo version and the full version
* The demo lobby is fully GUI-based; there is no arena.
* The demo lacks a story.
* Demo players can only start matches with bot players by default. During bot-only matches, the player can use any archetype that is not exclusive to the story. 
* Demo players can't start player-versus-player (PVP) matches by default, but they can play in matches that were started by party members who own the full version of the game. During PVP matches, the demo player can only use archetypes that the party host owns.
  * On weekends, demo players can start matches without the assistance of full version players.
* Progress and statistics from the demo are not saved by the server.
